Simple pixel-composition library for Python.

Blit can combine images and colors using different image blend modes, inspired
by the layers palette in GIMP or Adobe Photoshop. You can create a layer from
an image or color, and add new layers on top of it with a combination of opacity
(0 - 1), mask image, and blend mode.

>>> from Blit import Bitmap, adjustments
>>> photo = Bitmap('photo.jpg')
>>> sepia = adjustments.curves2([(0, 64), (128, 158), (255, 255)], [(0, 23), (128, 140), (255, 255)], [(0, 0), (128, 98), (255, 194)])
>>> oldphoto = photo.adjust(sepia)

>>> from Blit import Color
>>> purple = Color(50, 0, 100)
>>> orange = Color(255, 220, 180)
>>> duotone = purple.blend(orange, mask=photo)
